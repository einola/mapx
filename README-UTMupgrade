Readme for mapx library UTM update
Terry Haran 01/22/03

This document describes a set of changes to the mapx library implemented
in the course of adding the Transverse Mercator and Universal Transverse
Mercator projections. To date, none of these changes have been added yet
to the cvs repository.

In order to evaluate the changes, you should install the new version of
the library into some directory, leaving the old version of the library
intact. Assume that the new version of mapx is to be placed in a
directory called mapsnew. Then execute the following commands:

mkdir mapsnew
cd mapsnew
mkdir src
mkdir src/maps
mkdir bin
mkdir include
mkdir lib
mkdir lib/maps
cd src/maps
ftp sidads.colorado.edu
anonymous
<your email address>
cd pub/incoming/tharan/maps
bin
get mapsnew.tar.gz
quit
gunzip mapsnew.tar.gz
tar Uxvf maps_new.tar
make allall

If you don't have the latest released version of mapx installed, you can
retrieve it from the same ftp directory as above in the file
mapsold.tar.gz. Note that the Makefile in the released version will
install the software into the src, lib, and include directories under your
home directory. Note also that the "allall" target doesn't exist in the
released Makefile. You'll have do "make all" to make the library, and then
individual makes of the individual applications and test programs.

The following changes were made to all .c and .h files:

1) <module>_rcsid character strings were added where missing.

2) Any <module>_RCSID identifies were changed to <module>_rcsid.

3) The function id_<module>() was added to all .c files. This function
   returns a pointer to the rcsid string. This was done in order to
   suppress warnings as well as provide a means for applications to
   retrieve version information.

4) The following files were not modified since they were provided from
   third parties:
   a) isin.h
   b) isinusfor.c
   c) isinusinv.c
   d) wdbpltc.c
   The compilations of the above .c files still produce warnings.

In addition to the changes mentioned in 1-4, the following changes were
also made:

5) ppgc.html:
   a) Modified keywords Map Reference Latitude and Longitude default
      behavior for UTM.
   b) Added keywords Map Origin X and Y.
   c) Modified keywords Map False Easting and Northing default behavior
      for UTM.
   d) Added keywords Map Center Scale and Map UTM Zone.
   e) Fixed the spelling of Interrupted Homolosine Equal-Area. The
      mispelled form is still supported in the code.
   f) Added the following map projection names:
      i)   Polar Stereographic (ellipsoid)
      ii)  Transverse Mercator
      iii) Transverse Mercator (ellipsoid)
      iv)  Universal Transverse Mercator
      v)   Universal Transverse Mercator (ellipsoid)
   g) Added or expanded explanations of several map keywords including
      how the default values are modified for UTM.

6) Makefile:
   a) Changed TOPDIR from HOME to ../.. (temporary changed to aid in
      evaluation).
   b) Changed INSTALL from cp to cp -f so that old files are overwritten.
   c) Removed -DLSB1ST from CONFIG_FLAGS. Linux users should add it back.
   d) Added transverse_mercator and universal_transverse_mercator to
      PROJECTION_SRCS and PROJECTION_OBJS.
   e) Added targets:
      i)   allall
      ii)  appall
      iii) testall
      iv)  cleanall
      v)   cleanexes
   f) Under cdb_edit, changed "$(CP) cdb_edit.mpp $(MAPDIR)" to
      "$(INSTALL) cdb_edit.mpp $(MAPDIR)".
   g) Added build of xytest and gacct.
   h) Added $(INSTALL) for each test program.

7) The following changes were made to all projection .c files:
   a) For forward projection functions, the output parameters *u and *v were
      changed to *x and *y, respectively, and the following two lines of
      code:
	*u = current->T00*x + current->T01*y - current->u0;
	*v = current->T10*x + current->T11*y - current->v0;
      were replaced with:
	*x += current->false_easting;
	*y += current->false_northing;
      Note that "x" and "y" were changed from "double" to "float *".
   b) For inverse projection functions, the input parameters u and v were
      changed to x and y, respectively, and the following two lines of
      code:
        x =  current->T00*(u+current->u0) - current->T01*(v + current->v0);
        y = -current->T10*(u+current->u0) + current->T11*(v + current->v0);
      were replaced with
        x -= current->false_easting;
        y -= current->false_northing;
      Note that "x" and "y" were changed from double to float.
   c) Testing with macct indicates that these changes did degrade the
      accuracy somewhat, but it is still generally better than 1 meter.
      For example, for Azimuthal Equal Area:
      i)   macct N200correct.mpp:
	     Old: 
               102400 points,  0 bad points
               average error = 8.6325e-05 km
               std dev error = 1.3475e-04 km
               maximum error = 8.3848e-04 km
               max error was at 7.90N 37.81E
	     New:
               102400 points,  0 bad points
               average error = 1.1850e-04 km
               std dev error = 1.7604e-04 km
               maximum error = 9.7283e-04 km
               max error was at 1.41N 60.38W
   d) The accuracy of a few projections improved due to changing
      some temporary variables from float to double. For example,
      for Polar Stereographic Ellipsoid:
      i)   macct Sps.mpp:
             Old:
               102400 points,  0 bad points
               average error = 1.2009e-04 km
               std dev error = 1.8439e-04 km
               maximum error = 1.5249e-03 km
               max error was at 29.22S 157.43W
	     New:
               102400 points,  0 bad points
               average error = 8.6325e-05 km
               std dev error = 1.3475e-04 km
               maximum error = 8.3848e-04 km
               max error was at 7.90N 37.81E

8) cdb.c:
   a) In init_cb(), added a typecast on line 134 to suppress a warning.

9) cdb_edit.c:
   a) In main(), removed declaration of unused variables "i", "ios", and
      "extent".
   b) In finish_new_file(), removed declaration of unused variable
      "command".

10) cdb_list.c:
    a) In main(), removed unused variable "i".

11) cylindrical_equal_area.c:
    a) In cylindrical_equal_area() and cylindrical_equal_area_ellipsoid(),
       changed "dlon" from float to double.

12) cylindrical_equidistant.c:
    a) In cylindrical_equidistant(), changed "dlon" from float to double.

13) grids.c:
    a) In gtest main(), changed "enter r s: " prompt to "enter col row: ".
    b) Added gacct, a grid accuracy test similar to macct, but for .gpd
       files rather than .mpp files. gacct tests the accuracy for each
       point in the grid.

14) keyval.c:
    a) In get_value_keyval(), added feature such that if default_string is
       "FLT_MAX" and format is "%f" or "%lf", and the keyword is not
       found, then the value FLT_MAX is returned.

15) maps.c:
    a) Added asinz() which returns asin(x) such that x is constrained to
       fall within the range -1 to +1; called by
       inverse_transverse_mercator() in transvese_mercator.c.

16) maps.h:
    a) Added declaration of asinz().

17) mapx.c:
    a) Added declarations of the following functions:
       i)   init_transverse_mercator()
       ii)  transverse_mercator()
       iii) inverse_transverse_mercator()
       iv)  init_transverse_mercator_ellipsoid()
       v)   transverse_mercator_ellipsoid()
       vi)  inverse_transverse_mercator_ellipsoid()
       vii) init_universal_transverse_mercator()
       viii)init_universal_transverse_mercator_ellipsoid()
       Note that no forward or inverse functions for UTM are declared,
       since UTM uses transverse mercator forward and inverse functions.
     b) In new_mapx(), added initialization for Transverse Mercator and
        Universal Transverse Mercator.
     c) In decode_mpp():
        i)   Added code to make Map Reference Latitude and Longitude
             optional keywords for UTM.
        ii)  Added code to process Map Origin X and Y keywords. These
	     values are stored in x0 and y0 in the mapx structure.
        iii) Deferred assuming that Map Origin Latitude and Longitude
             take on Reference Latitude and Longitude values,
             respectively, when the former are not defined and the
             projection is UTM until UTM initialization.
        iv)  Changed assignment of Map False Easting and Northing keyword
             values from u0, v0 to false_easting, false_northing,
             respectively, in the mapx structure.
	v)   Deferred assigning of default values to Map False Easting and
             Northing keywords when they are not defined and the
             projection is UTM until UTM initialization.
        vi)  Added code to process Map Center Scale and Map UTM Zone
             keywords.
     d) In old_fixed_format_decode_mpp():
        i) Added code to initialize the following new mpp parameters that
           are not supported by the old format:
             x0
             y0
	     false_easting
	     false_northing
	     center_scale
	     utm_zone
     e) In reinit_mapx():
        i)   If Map Origin X and Y not provided, then forward transform
             Map Origin Latitude and Longitude (center_lat and center_lon
             in the mapx structure) into Map Origin X and Y (x0 and y0
             in the mapx structure).
        ii)  Changed the initialization of u0 and v0 in the mapx structure.
	     The old definitions of u0 and v0 were false easting and false
             northing, respectively. The new definition is the u and v values
	     resulting from the forward rotation (if any) of (x0,y0). Thus
             (x0,y0) serves as the center of the rotation.
     f) In forward_mapx():
        i)   Changed call to (*(this->geo_to_map))() so that pointers to
             temporary float variables x and y are passed rather than u and
             v. (x,y) is then rotated and translated to (u,v). Note there
             is now some loss of precision since x and y used to be doubles
	     in each forward projection function.
     g) In inverse_mapx():
        i)   Translate and rotate (u,v) to temporary floats (x,y). Note
             there is now some loss of precision since x and y used to be
             doubles in each inverse projection function. Changed call to
             (*(this->map_to_geo))() so that x and y are passed rather than
             u and v.
     h) Added mapx_forward_xy converts (lat,lon) to (x,y).
     i) Added mapx_inverse_xy converts (x,y) to (lat,lon).
     j) In standard_name():
	i)   Added support for correct spelling of "interrupted" for
	     Goode Interrupted Homolosine Equal Area. Incorrect spelling
             is still supported.
	ii)  Added Transverse Mercator.
	iii) Added Transverse Mercator Ellipsoid.
	iv)  Added Universal Transverse Mercator.
	v)   Added Universal Transverse Mercator Ellipsoid.
     k) Added main program xytest, an interactive test for mapx routines
        that is similar to mtest, but works with original map coordinates
        (x,y) rather than rotated and translated coordinates (u,v).
     l) In mtest:
        i)   Changed declaration of readln[80] to readln[FILENAME_MAX].
	ii)  Added ability to specify the .mpp file name on the command
             line just as in gtest.

18) mapx.h:
    a) Added user specified constants:
       i)   x0
       ii)  y0
       iii) false_easting
       iv)  false_northing
       v)   center_scale
       vi)  utm_zone
    b) Added private projection constants:
       i)   e0
       ii)  e1p
       iii) e2p
       iv)  e3p
       v)   ml0
       vi)  esp
       vii) f1
       viii)f2
       ix)  f3
       x)   f4
    c) Added funtion prototypes:
       i)   forward_mapx_xy()
       ii)  inverse_mapx_xy()

19) mercator.c:
    a) In mercator(), changed "dlon" from float to double.

20) mollweide.c:
    a) In mollweide(), changed "dlon" from float to double.

21) orthographic.c:
    a) In orthographic(), changed the following temporary variables
       from float to double:
       i)   phi
       ii)  lam
       iii) sin_phi
       iv)  cos_phi
       v)   sin_lam
       vi)  cos_lam
       vii) cos_beta

22) polar_stereographic.c:
    a) In polar_stereographic(), changed the following temporary variables
       from float to double:
       i)   phi
       ii)  lam
       iii) rho
    b) In init_polar_stereographic_ellipsoid(), changed the following
       temporary variables from float to double:
       i)   numerator
       ii)  denominator
    c) In polar_stereographic_ellipsoid(), changed the following
       temporary variables from float to double:
       i)   phi
       ii)  lam
       iii) rho
       iv)  t
       v)   numerator
       vi)  denominator

23) sinusoidal.c:
    a) In sinusoidal(), changed "dlon" from float to double.

24) Added transverse_mercator.c.

25) Added universal_transverse_mercator.c.
