    General install directions for the mapx library and tools
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The make file is set up for installation to a local directory tree that
looks like this:

TOPDIR/
	bin
	include
	lib

By default TOPDIR = $(HOME)

To change that use 'make TOPDIR=new_top_dir ...'

The default target for the make file is "all", which will build and install
the library.

To build and install the the library and all the standalone applications
use the target "allall".

As delivered the Makefile is set up for Intel machines. For other
architectures that don't use least significant byte first you must change
the CONFIG_CFLAGS variable. Either edit the Makefile and remove -DLSB1ST
or specify 'make CONFIG_CFLAGS="-O" ...' on the command line.

The "configuration section" of the make file has additional instructions.
You should not have to change anything outside of the configuration
section.

See the README file for contact information if you need help.
