<a name="intro"><H2>Introduction</H2></a>

Satellite remote sensing has made possible the collection of data over
large areas of the Earth. These data are often stored in
&quot;grids.&quot; Grids are an efficient means of storing data because
the location of a value within the grid is implicit, i.e. it is not
explicitly stored in the grid. The location is also constant,
facilitating comparison of data from different sensors or different
time periods. The purpose of this document is to give a brief
introduction to mapping, gridding, and the associated terminology.
Many different conventions are in use and no widely accepted standards
exist. The intent here is not to dictate usage but rather to clarify
and provide a context in which to discuss issues of exactly how data
are stored in grids at NSIDC.<p>
<a name="maps"><H2>Maps</H2></a>

When we speak of a map projection we are talking about some procedure
or mathematical formula to transform a curved surface into a plane. A
map projection is a one to one mapping (in the mathematical sense) of
points on the curved surface to points on the plane. The curved
surface is usually the surface of the Earth and the plane is what we
call a &quot;map.&quot; The derivation of a map transformation requires a
mathematical representation of the surface of the Earth. The surface
of constant geopotential referred to as mean sea level or the geoid is
quite complicated and its mathematical form is correspondingly
complex. When defining map projections then, it is common to
approximate the surface of the earth with a simpler surface such as an
ellipsoid or sphere. The ellipsoid is flattened at the poles, relative
to the sphere, by about one part in three hundred, so for maps of
large areas (continents or bigger) no significant error is introduced
by using the sphere. On the other hand, when mapping smaller areas it
is not uncommon to choose an ellipsoid specifically for each area
(i.e. each area is mapped on an ellipsoid with a different radius and
eccentricity).<P>

Coordinates for points on the surface of the Earth are given in
latitude and longitude. Geodetic latitude is the angle between a
vertical ray at the point and the plane of the equator. Geocentric
latitude is the angle between a ray from the center of the Earth to
the point and the plane of the equator. On a sphere, the geodetic
latitude is equivalent to the geocentric latitude. There is only one
definition of longitude, which is, the angle between a ray from the
center of the Earth to the point and the plane of the Greenwich
Meridian (an arbitrary reference point). Coordinates in the map plane
(<I>x</I>,<I>y</I>) are defined in the usual manner with <I>x</I>
horizontal and increasing to the right and <I>y</I> vertical and
increasing upward.

<a name="projections"><H2>Projections</H2></a>

Map transformations are referred to as projections because they are
commonly conceptualized as geometric constructs. That is, we think of
the map as a piece of paper wrapped around a globe with lines
emanating from points on the globe and &quot;projected&quot; onto the
paper.<A HREF = #note1>1</A><A NAME = "ref1"> </A> Map projections
are specified as a set of equations giving <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> in
terms of <I>latitude</I> and <I>longitude</I>. The form of the
equations can be thought of as the manner in which we wrap the paper
around the globe.  Cylindrical projections wrap the paper around in a
tube, conical projections use a cone, and azimuthal projections use a
flat surface.  Several parameters are used in these equations to
specify exactly where the surface intersects the globe, the scale or
size of the globe, and the translation and rotation of the map on the
plane surface. There is no one best map projection. Each projection
has different properties and thus different &quot;best&quot; uses. Two
of the most important characteristics of maps are whether they are
conformal or equal-area. No map projection is both, and some are
neither. If a map is conformal then angles within a small area are
reproduced accurately. This means that shapes are preserved, i.e. a
small circle on the globe will look like a small circle on the map.
Formally we say that at any point on the map, the scale <I>h</I> along
a meridian of longitude is equal to the scale <I>k</I> along a
parallel of latitude. If a map is said to be equal-area, then a small
circle placed anywhere on the map will always cover the same amount of
area on the globe and the product of <I>h</I> and <I>k</I> at any
point is one. For maps which are not equal-area <I>hk</I> - 1 gives a
measure of the areal distortion. For maps which are not conformal
<I>k</I>/<I>h</I> gives the aspect ratio which is a measure of shape
distortion. For example, on the Polar Stereographic map true at
70N (a conformal map) the areal distortion varies from -6% at the
pole to +29% at 45N and goes up to +276% at the equator while, by
definition, the aspect ratio remains 1:1 everywhere. The Azimuthal
Equal-Area map over the pole has, of course, no areal distortion,
while the aspect ratio varies from 1:1 at the pole to 1.17:1 at
45N and goes up to 2:1 at the equator.

<a name="grids"><H2>Grids</H2></a>

A grid is an array of points. Grids are used to record regularly
spaced samples over an area. When sampling over the surface of the
earth a grid is determined by a map projection, a sampling interval,
an origin, and the number of rows and columns.<A HREF =
#note2>2</A><A NAME = "ref2"> </A> A grid coordinate system is
defined in the map plane with axes parallel to the rows and columns of
the grid and units equal to the sampling interval. The grid sample
locations are then at the whole integer grid coordinate points.  To
conform to mathematical array conventions the grid coordinates
(<I>r</I>,<I>s</I>) start at (0,0) in the upper left corner with
<I>r</I> increasing to the right and <I>s</I> increasing downward
(this also conforms to digital image processing conventions). A grid
cell (<I>i</I>,<I>j</I>) is defined as the area between grid
coordinates <I>i</I>-.5 and <I>i</I>+.5, and <I>j</I>-.5 and
<I>j</I>+.5. To conform to rounding conventions the lower bound is
included in the cell while the upper bound is not (round up at .5).
Note that the <I>r</I> coordinate corresponds to the grid column
number <I>j</I>, and the <I>s</I> coordinate corresponds to the grid
row number <I>i</I>.<P>

It might be useful to think of the grid as a map drawn on graph paper.
To find a grid cell location, count graph lines over from the left and
down from the top, then read the latitude and longitude off the map.<P>

<a name="binning"><H2>Binning</H2></a>

The process of sampling data on a grid is sometimes referred to as
binning, especially when the sampling method is to average all data
which falls into the grid cell. Some other methods used to sample data
are: take the closest value to the grid point (nearest neighbor), or
interpolate between surrounding grid points.  Also, binning doesn't
necessarily have to be the average of multiple data points, it could
be the minimum, the maximum, the median or the latest value in the
grid cell. The characteristics of the data should determine the
sampling method used. For example, nearest neighbor works quite well
for elevation data, where as averaging or bilinear interpolation are
terrible. When magnifying an image, interpolation is the way to go,
but for shrinking, averaging is usually best.

<a name="pictures"><H2>Pictures</H2></a>

A pixel coordinate system is defined analogously to the grid
coordinate system; pixels are analogous to grid cells. To display
gridded data as a picture, we define a transformation from grid
coordinates to pixel coordinates and then sample the gridded data at
the whole integer pixel coordinate points. The most common technique
is to map grid cells onto pixels one for one, but there are more
sophisticated techniques which allow for scrolling, zooming, and
rotating. This is often referred to as resampling.

<a name="parameters"><H2>Parameters</H2></a>

Many programs that we use at NSIDC depend on the &quot;mapx&quot;
module to handle map projections. These include: popview, gomap,
olsgrid, mapenum, and the EASE-Grid processing software. Most of these
tools provide access to pre-defined maps, however, it is relatively
easy to define your own map with a map projection parameters or &quot;.mpp&quot; file.<P>

<H3>Map Projection Parameters File Format</H3></a>

Each parameter is described by a "keyword: value" pair on a single
line. Parameters can be followed by comments which begin with a
semi-colon. Parameters can appear in any order.&nbsp; The default value is
used in the case where the corresponding keyword is not
found. Unrecognized keywords are ignored. The following parameters define
the map projection.<p>

</ul><p>

Map names are not case sensitive, white space and dashes are ignored, and
most word permutations are acceptable. For example, "Equal-Area
Cylindrical" is equivalent to "CYLINDRICAL EQUALAREA".<p>
 The reference latitude and longitude specify the original location and
orientation of the map projection. The origin of the rectangular map
coordinate system can then be rotated and translated with the Rotation and
Origin keywords.<p>
 For the Cylindrical Equal-Area, and Polar Stereographic projections the
second reference latitude specifies the latitude of "true"
scale. Conceptually, where the projection plane intersects the
surface. For the Albers Conic Equal-Area, and Lambert Conic Conformal
projections the conic plane is secant to the surface between the reference
latitude and the second reference latitude.<p>
  The equatorial radius and eccentricity specify the surface to be mapped
(usually the Earth's surface). The scale and the equatorial radius
determine the map units. For example if the radius is in kilometers (as is
the case with the default) and the scale is 1.0 then the map units will be
kilometers.  PostScript units are inches, so for PostScript output you
would specify kilometers per inch. For a grid you can define the scale in
terms of kilometers per grid cell. The gridding module &quot;grids&quot;
also has parameters which specify grid cells per map unit. This allows the
same .mpp file to be used for multiple nested grids.<p>

 The remaining parameters are used by programs that actually draw maps
(e.g. psmap, mapenum). The southern, northern, western, and eastern bounds
of the map are the starting point for the graticule and are used to speed
up the search in the map outline data base. They cannot be counted on to
clip the map accurately. All longitudes should be in the range -180 to
+360.  West to east should not span more than 360 degrees. West specifies
the left side of the map and east the right, not necessarily the minimum
and maximum longitudes.<p>
 The latitude and longitude graticule intervals specify the spacing
between graticule lines. The graticule is the overlay of latitude and
longitude lines on the map. By default a parallel is drawn every 30
degrees starting at the bottom of the map (90.00S) and a meridian is drawn
every 30 degrees starting at the left side of the map (180.00W).  Label
latitude and longitude specify the parallel and meridian along which to
draw the graticule line labels.<p>
 The last three numbers are used by the data base search routine to
specify the level of detail for map lines. The level refers to the number
and size of features which will be selected, as oppossed to resolution of
each feature. The higher the number the more detail will be included. For
example level 1 will include only the largest features, such as, whole
continents, while level 2 would also include some smaller features like
large lakes. In either case the continental outline will appear with the
same amount of detail (the same jaggedness).<p>

<a name="limitations"><H2>Limitations </H2></a>

These modules, maps and grids, are very flexible, but they do impose
certain restrictions on the kinds of grids that can be defined. All
grids must be rectangular arrays. Rectangular arrays are easy to use
with existing scientific visualization tools, like IDL, PV~WAVE,
Khoros, and Explorer, but they may be inefficient in terms of storage
space for non-rectangular data sets. If some flag value (for example
zero) is stored in the unused cells then this wasted space can be
compacted by any good data compression scheme. This same invalid data
flag can be used within the grid as well, leading to further storage
savings.  Another restriction is that each grid must be based on a map
projection defined in mapx. Many of the most useful projections have
already been implemented and fortunately it is rather easy, given a
mathematical formulation of the forward and inverse transformations,
to add a new projection to mapx (see source code for instructions).
The mathematical formulations of most common map projections are quite
straight forward and can be found in the references below.
